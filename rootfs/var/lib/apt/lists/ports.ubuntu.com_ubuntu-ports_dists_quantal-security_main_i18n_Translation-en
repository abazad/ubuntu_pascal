Package: apache2
Description-md5: d24f049cd70ccfc178dd8974e4b1ed01
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server metapackage
 The Apache Software Foundation's goal is to build a secure, efficient and
 extensible HTTP server as standards-compliant open source software. The
 result has long been the number one web server on the Internet.
 .
 It features support for HTTPS, virtual hosting, CGI, SSI, IPv6, easy
 scripting and database integration, request/response filtering, many
 flexible authentication schemes, and more.

Package: apache2-doc
Description-md5: 268d5339b3063f1f4a1f8ba078480a2a
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server documentation
 This package provides the documentation for Apache 2. For more details

Package: apache2-mpm-event
Description-md5: a80d3fe69689b28f8aea325690e6e8f5
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - event driven model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The event MPM is designed to allow more requests to be served
 simultaneously by passing off some processing work to supporting
 threads, freeing up the main threads to work on new requests. It is
 especially suitable for sites that see extensive KeepAlive traffic.
 .
 This MPM is experimental and less tested than the worker and prefork MPMs.

Package: apache2-mpm-prefork
Description-md5: b1e3963f43f27f985efabc714e30a17e
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - traditional non-threaded model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The prefork MPM provides a non-threaded implementation using a variable
 number of processes where each process handles only one connection
 at the same time. It is not as fast as threaded models, but is considered to
 be more stable. It is appropriate for sites that need to maintain
 compatibility with non-thread-safe libraries, and is the best MPM for
 isolating each request, so that a problem with a single request will not
 affect any other.

Package: apache2-mpm-worker
Description-md5: 5c9df5383d0a2631ae15ced2ca0389d7
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - high speed threaded model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The worker MPM provides the default threaded implementation. It is
 recommended especially for high-traffic sites because it is faster
 and has a smaller memory footprint than the traditional prefork MPM.
