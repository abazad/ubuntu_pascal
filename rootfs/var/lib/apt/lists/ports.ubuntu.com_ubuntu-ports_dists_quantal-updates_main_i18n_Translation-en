Package: apache2-mpm-event
Description-md5: a80d3fe69689b28f8aea325690e6e8f5
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - event driven model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The event MPM is designed to allow more requests to be served
 simultaneously by passing off some processing work to supporting
 threads, freeing up the main threads to work on new requests. It is
 especially suitable for sites that see extensive KeepAlive traffic.
 .
 This MPM is experimental and less tested than the worker and prefork MPMs.

Package: apache2-mpm-prefork
Description-md5: b1e3963f43f27f985efabc714e30a17e
Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - traditional non-threaded model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The prefork MPM provides a non-threaded implementation using a variable
 number of processes where each process handles only one connection
 at the same time. It is not as fast as threaded models, but is considered to
 be more stable. It is appropriate for sites that need to maintain
 compatibility with non-thread-safe libraries, and is the best MPM for
 isolating each request, so that a problem with a single request will not
 affect any other.

Package: apache2-mpm-worker

Description-en: Apache HTTP Server - high speed threaded model
 Each Apache Multi-Processing Module provides a different "flavor" of
 web server binary, compiled with a different processing model.
 .
 The worker MPM provides the default threaded implementation. It is
 recommended especially for high-traffic sites because it is faster
 and has a smaller memory footprint than the traditional prefork MPM.

Description-md5: 8c2dd471f4dbeb52cefdbe65edd291f7
Description-en: Boost.Python Library development files
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++
 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to
 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your
 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++
 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The
 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into
 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:
 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions
 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of
 numeric operators among others.
 .
 This package also contains the pyste Boost.Python code generator that
 allows the user to specify classes and functions to be exported using
 a simple interface file, which following the Boost.Python's
 philosophy, is simple Python code.
 .
 This package allows development of a Python interface for all current
 versions of Python in Debian.  Code using this library will need also
 one of the Python development packages.

 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often
 used in text processing; many users will be familiar with the Unix
 utilities grep, sed and awk, and the programming language perl, each
 of which make extensive use of regular expressions. Traditionally C++
 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Package: lintian
Description-md5: f0d8ae5ba8e9f66ee137a1ae80d6b5c6
Description-en: Debian package checker
 Lintian dissects Debian packages and reports bugs and policy
 violations. It contains automated checks for many aspects of Debian
 policy as well as some checks for common errors.
 .
 It uses an archive directory, called laboratory, in which it stores
 information about the packages it examines.  It can keep this
 information between multiple invocations in order to avoid repeating
 expensive data-collection operations. This makes it possible to check the
 complete Debian archive for bugs, in a reasonable time.
 .
 This package is useful for all people who want to check Debian
 packages for compliance with Debian policy. Every Debian maintainer
 should check packages with this tool before uploading them to the
 archive.
 .
 This version of Lintian is calibrated for policy version 3.9.3.

Description-en: Linux Standard Base sendmail dummy
 The Linux Standard Base (http://www.linuxbase.org/) is a standard
 core system that third-party applications written for Linux can
 depend upon.
 .
 This package contains nothing else than a fake /usr/sbin/sendmail
 command to fulfill the LSB's requirement of providing this command without
 requiring an MTA to get installed, which once introduces a daemon which
 can cause security problems and second, users get asked questions about
 how they want their MTA configured when in reality they simply wanted to
 install a deskltop application or a printer driver, but the dependency on
 LSB compliance pulls in an MTA with the installation.
 .
 The LSB requirement on /usr/sbin/sendmail comes from old times where Linux
 and Unix machines had all fixed IPs and did server tasks in data centers.
 Today's typical desktop Linux machines do not do local e-mail any more as
 users use external e-mail services.
 .
 The /usr/sbin/sendmail always exits with exit status -1 (255) and sends a
 warning message to stderr, so that if a program actually tries to send e-mail
 via the sendmail command the user gets note.

 be useful for programmatically distinguishing between a pure Debian

Package: ubuntu-defaults-builder
Description-md5: add8d6d8ce217beb06d5c16ac3ff8caf
Description-en: create Ubuntu customization packages
 This tool allows you to create a "default settings" package for Ubuntu. The
 "ubuntu-defaults-template" script will generate a source package with the
 customizable settings (e. g.  desktop/background.jpg and
 webbrowser/bookmarks-menu.txt). When built and installed, it will take the
 necessary actions to modify the system-wide defaults for desktops, programs,
 etc.
 .
 The main purpose for this is to provide a standard and safe way to create
 localized Ubuntu images, or OEM custom projects.
 .
 You can customize the following settings:
 .
  * Web browser start page, default search engine, and bookmarks (supports
    Firefox right now)
  * Unity/Unity 2D launchers
  * Desktop background (for GNOME right now)
  * Default desktop session in LightDM/gdm
  * Default radio stations in Rhythmbox and Banshee
  * Extra dependencies (Depends: and Recommends:), i. e. packages that are
    installed by default on the customized image
  * Internationalization (default locale, keyboard layout, language support)
    (only for built images, not configured by the defaults package itself)

Package: ubuntu-drivers-common

Description-en: Detect and install additional Ubuntu driver packages
 This package aggregates and abstracts Ubuntu specific logic and knowledge
 about third-party driver packages. It provides:
 .
  - a Python API for detecting driver packages for a particular piece of
    hardware or the whole system.
 .
  - an "ubuntu-drivers" command line tool to list or install driver packages
    (mostly for integration in installers).
 .
  - a PackageKit plugin for WhatProvides() for types MODALIAS and
    HARDWARE_DRIVER, to do the same queries as above through the PackageKit API
    (for using in non-distro specific GUIs). This works with aptdaemon's
    PackageKit compatibility layer (python3-aptdaemon.pkcompat) and with
    PackageKit's apt backend, but _not_ with the PackageKit aptcc backend.
 .
  - some NVidia specific support code to find the most appropriate driver
    version, as well as setting up the alternatives symlinks that the
    proprietary NVidia and FGLRX packages use.

Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
