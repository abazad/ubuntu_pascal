Description-en: multiuser MPM for Apache 2.2
 The ITK Multi-Processing Module (MPM) works in about the same way as the
 classical "prefork" module (that is, without threads), except that it allows
 you to constrain each individual vhost to a particular system user. This
 allows you to run several different web sites on a single server without
 worrying that they will be able to read each others' files. This is a
 third-party MPM that is not included in the normal Apache httpd.
 .
 Please note that this MPM is somewhat less tested than the MPMs that come with
 Apache itself.

 and private cloud providers regardless of size, by being simple to implement
 and massively scalable.
 .
 OpenStack Compute, codenamed Nova, is a cloud computing fabric controller. In
 addition to its "native" API (the OpenStack API), it also supports the Amazon
 EC2 API.
 .
 Nova is intended to be modular and easy to extend and adapt. It supports many
 different hypervisors (KVM and Xen to name a few), different database backends
 (SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, for instance), different types of user
 databases (LDAP or SQL), etc.

 named using the Ruby library compatibility version, which is sometimes
 confusing for users who do not follow Ruby development closely. This package
 depends on the ruby1.9.1 package, and provides compatibility symbolic links
 from 1.9.3 executables and manual pages to their 1.9.1 counterparts.
